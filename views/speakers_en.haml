        %h1 Aaron Patterson
        %h2
          from
          %span ATTi
        %p
          When he isn’t ruining people’s lives by writing software like phuby, enterprise, and neversaydie, Aaron can be found writing slightly more useful software like nokogiri. To keep up his Gameboy Lifestyle, Aaron spends his weekdays writing high quality software for ATTi. Be sure to catch him on Karaoke night, where you can watch him sing his favorite smooth rock hits of the 70’s and early 80’s.

        %p
          Man of letters and numbers working with Ruby, Lua and others. Anglo/hispano/lusophile. Code, linguistics, samba, and of course, beer.

        %p He works as a cofounder and Principal Developer of Ruby Labs. Ruby Labs is a division within Business Vision S.A., an Argentine software development company with offices in Buenos Aires, La Plata, San Francisco and Miami. Business Vision has been successful for many years working primarily with Java and .NET, and now he's helping them move into dynamic languages: first with Ruby, but with more to come.

        %p At the moment he programs primarily with Ruby for work and Lua for fun. In the past he worked quite a bit with Java and PHP. I'm a fan of programming in general and like well-made things, regardless of what technology they use. His focus is on back-end systems and web application architecture.
