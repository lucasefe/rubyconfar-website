        %h2 What is Ruby On Rails?
        %p Ruby on Rails is an open source web framework, optimized to make the software developers life easier and boost their productivity. Web development has become easier thanks to the philosophy of "convention over configuration", which by making choices about the basic configuration of a website, saves the developer from building everything 'from scratch'. During the conference you will have the opportunity to learn much more about the power of Riding The Rails.

      %p With a unique architecture and a building that was constructed during the 1920's and used as a manufacturing and storage center for oil until 1992, years later the space was transformed. The Clorindo Testa and Associates Studio was commissioned to transform the old oil factory into an original cultural space while maintaining the architectural details that make the space unique.

      %p Today the cultural center occupies the majority of the original space and allows the original space to coexist with a new artistic purpose, with the common goal of providing cultural enrichment and a space for artistic community.
