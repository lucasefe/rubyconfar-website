    %h1 RubyConf Argentina is now accepting proposals for talks. 

    %h2 Proposals will be accepted until Sunday 7/31/2011 at midnight PDT.

    %p Talks will be 45 minutes with no extra time for questions. Remember that nearly all our attendees use Ruby daily, so talks should be for an audience of intermediate or advanced Rubyists. Non-Ruby topics are acceptable if they are somehow related to Ruby, or just seriously awesome.

    %p If your talk is selected you will receive a free pass to attend the conference and get some special speaker swag too. At that point we'll need a photo of you for the website/program.

    %p Questions? email rubyconfar@gmail.com
